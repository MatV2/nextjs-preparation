This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Maintenance Mode

This project includes a maintenance page that can be enabled when needed. To enable maintenance mode:

1. Create a `.env.local` file based on the `.env.local.example` template
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` in your `.env.local` file
3. Restart the server

When maintenance mode is enabled, all visitors will be redirected to the maintenance page. You can configure specific IPs to bypass the maintenance mode by adding them to the `ALLOWED_IPS` environment variable as a comma-separated list.

The maintenance page is located at `/maintenance` and can be customized by editing the files in `src/app/maintenance/`.
